# Joint Radar and Communication (JRC) System Simulation

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for a **Joint Radar and Communication (JRC) System**, developed as part of an undergraduate project. The JRC system integrates radar and communication functionalities within a single platform, achieving efficient resource utilization and spectrum efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- **Radar System**
  - High-resolution target detection using PMCW and OFDM waveforms.
  - Range-Doppler maps for target localization and velocity estimation.
  
- **Communication System**
  - Reliable data transmission using BPSK and OFDM modulation.
  - Channel modeling with line-of-sight and multipath propagation.
  - Performance evaluation through constellation diagrams and BER analysis.

- **Integration of Radar and Communication**
  - Dual functionality with resource sharing.
  - Multibeam optimization for radar-communication tradeoffs.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
